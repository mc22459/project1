create a set of objects (1 per person in your group) which are somehow connected by a non-printed found object

I picked an apple and created an overly complicated pedastool for it so that it might be presented upright. 
On its own the apple slants heavily. Using a caliper I measured the dimensions of the apple's bottom, then in rhino
I designed a stand that would force it to stand upright. The message speaks to the general application of 3d printed items. 
Thus far, it seems that 3d printing is used for similairly specific--if "useless"--purposes. 
3d printing will reach its peak when it's application spreads more easily to the realm of biological material. 
This is why the organic material--the apple--is on a pedastool. Keeping it upright is about the potential of the marriage 
between the organic and the fabricated. Below is an article referenced in the creation of my project.
